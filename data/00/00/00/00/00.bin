  |   No run will ever be the same with randomized stages, enemies,         |
  |   bosses, and items. Play solo, or team up with up to four friends to   |
  |   fight through hordes of monsters, unlock new loot, and find a way     |
  |   to escape the planet. Additional survivors, stages, items, enemies,   |
  |   and features are still in active development and will be added in     |
  |   multiple free content updates.                                        |

  |   This is the second major content update for Risk of Rain 2 on         |
  |   console. With this update we are focusing on Skills 2.0, brand new    |
  |   content, as well as other general changes and quality of life         |
  |   improvements.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Skills 2.0 introduces a new way to play your favorite survivor! Our   |
  |   new "Loadout" system allows for swappable skills and skins at the     |
  |   beginning of each run. Each survivor will maintain their unique       |
  |   identity, but have some options to tinker with before jumping into    |
  |   a run. While some skill variants play off existing skills, some       |
  |   variants are entirely unique abilities available to a survivor.       |
  |   Each new skill and skin in your Loadout will be unlocked only with    |
  |   survivor-specific challenges - good luck! More skills and skins are   |
  |   planned to be added in future updates.                                |
  |                                                                         |
